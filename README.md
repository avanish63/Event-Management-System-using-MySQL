Event Management System

The Event Management System is a desktop application designed to manage events during college fests. It provides an intuitive interface built using Java Swing and leverages SQL for database management. This system simplifies event scheduling, participant registration, and tracking, ensuring smooth execution of multiple events during the fest.

Features
Event Creation & Management: Users can create, edit, and delete events with details like date, time, location, and description.
Participant Registration: Register participants for various events and store their details securely in the database.
Database Connectivity: SQL is used for creating tables, storing event and participant information, and querying data. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is implemented to link Java Swing with the SQL server.
User-friendly Interface: Java Swing provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that is easy to navigate, making event management hassle-free.
